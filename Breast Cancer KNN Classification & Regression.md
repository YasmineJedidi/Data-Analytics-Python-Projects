## Interpretation

The best Hyperparameters for KNN classification in this case are:manhattan as a distance, n_neighbors= 11,and uniform weights.

In the context of the breast cancer dataset, accuracy represents the percentage of correctly classified samples (i.e., how often the model correctly predicts whether a tumor is malignant or benign)

With a **0.947% accuracy score**, the model classifies 65 Malignant cancer cases correctly, and only 2 incorrectly (2 Patients have Benign breast cancer but have dignosed with Malignant cancer). And 4 patients with Malignant cancer have been dignosed with Benign breast cancer.

## Regression Interpretation
* The best hyperparameters found by the grid search are printed using the best_params_ attribute of the grid search object.
* The KNN model is fitted on the training data

KNN regression is not suitable for this dataset because it is a binary classification, and the accuracy is low compared to KNN classification.
